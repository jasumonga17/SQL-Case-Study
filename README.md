# SQL-Case-Study

**Case Study 1: Taste of Success**

**Problem Statement**
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent, and which menu items are their favorites. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program; additionally, he needs help generating some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues, but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

**Case Study 2: Pizza Runner**

**Problem Statement**
Did you know that over 115 million kilograms of pizza are consumed daily worldwide?

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire, so he had one more genius idea to combine with it: he was going to Uberize it, and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.
